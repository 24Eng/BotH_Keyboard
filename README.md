I use macros at work and home all the time, but sometimes pressing shift + alt + control + W or some other hard-to-remember combination isn't the best. Gamers have used off-hand keyboards for a while, and I love mine, but they're only helpful if you're at your battle station. I have seen folks put macro buttons on a footstool and use their toes, and that kind of ingenuity got me thinking. I wanted to keep my hands free and add wireless flexibility. Leveraging my experience with wearables, I got BOTH. 

The Back of the Hand keyboard gives me four programmable buttons by extending a finger backward. I can twist a screwdriver and pause the music on my phone or hold an electrical probe and command the computer to activate a test point.

Four is not a lot, so the wheel lets me change layers without fuss. I can go from obscure keyboard buttons to Pokemon Go (-o-) in a second. The case is entirely 3D printed. It accepts standard Cherry MX keyswitches so that you can choose clicky or silent operation. It uses an Apple Watch band so that you can choose any color. I like the black elastic, but the stainless Milanese looks sharp.

I would probably use a larger battery if I built a second one, but it is still possible to use this while connected to any USB charger. The core is an ESP32 and uses Bluetooth Low-Energy to emulate a keyboard.
